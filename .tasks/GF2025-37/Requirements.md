# Present Complaint Module

## Overview
The Present Complaint module provides a comprehensive view of all complaints across all shops and users in the cardshop system. It integrates with the existing complaint infrastructure while providing a unified interface for viewing and managing complaints.

## Architecture
This module follows the established MVC pattern used throughout the units folder:

### Structure

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ css/present-complaint.css        # Styling
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ js/present-complaint.class.js    # JavaScript class

- jQuery (for DOM manipulation)
- Bootstrap (for UI components)

### Performance Considerations
- Pagination for large datasets (handled by backend)
- Debounced search to reduce API calls
- Efficient DOM manipulation for smooth UI

## Integration Points

### With Existing Complaint System
- Uses same API patterns as `cardshop/cards/getComplaint/{userid}`
- Uses same API patterns as `cardshop/cards/getComplaintList/{shopID}`
- Maintains compatibility with existing complaint editing workflow

### With Company List Module
- Follows same architectural patterns
- Uses similar search and display logic
- Consistent UI/UX approach

### Menu Integration
The module is integrated into the main system navigation via:
- Direct addition to [`controller/tabController.php`](controller/tabController.php) loadFrontPermission function
- "presentComplaint" case added to [`views/js/biz.js`](views/js/biz.js) bizType.trail function
- Standalone [`view.php`](units/cardshop/presentcomplaint/view.php) for iframe loading
- **No special permissions required** - available to all users like "Min side"

### System Level Integration
Since the present-complaint module provides a comprehensive view across ALL shops and users (not just cardshop-specific), it's properly positioned at the system level in the main bizType navigation alongside:
- Valgshops (permission-based)
- Gavekort-shops (permission-based)
- GaveAdmin (permission-based)
- System administration (permission-based)
- Infoboard (permission-based)
- Shopboard (permission-based)
- Min side (available to all)
- **üìã Present Complaints (available to all)** ‚Üê New addition

- All database queries use parameterized statements
- Input validation on all user inputs
- Proper escaping of output data
- Access control through existing authentication system

## Future Enhancements

- Advanced filtering options
- Complaint status tracking
- Email notifications for new complaints
- Analytics and reporting dashboard
