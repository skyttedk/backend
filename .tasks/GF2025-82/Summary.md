# Summary - Reservation System Changes

Implementation completed for GF2025-82: Reservation system improvements with column removal and approval workflow.

## Changes Implemented

### Task 1: Column Removal
- **Removed three columns** from reservation table in `units/valgshop/approval/js/main.js`:
  - "Registreres i NAV" (skip_navision)
  - "Lager overv�ges" (ship_monitoring) 
  - "Autopilot" (autotopilot)
- **Updated table headers** and row cells to remove the unwanted columns
- **Cleaned up JavaScript** to remove unused checkbox handling and data submission
- **Simplified data payload** in save operations to exclude removed fields

### Task 2: Approval Workflow for External Items
- **Created separate approval controller** (`controller/reservationControllerApproval.php`) with validation logic:
  - Added `validateReservationForApproval()` method to check external items and NAV stock impact
  - Added `createApprovalRequest()` method to handle approval workflow
  - Added `sendApprovalEmail()` method for notification to kss@gavefabrikken.dk
  - Added transaction handling for data consistency

- **Created new database structure**:
  - New table `present_reservation_qty_approval` for tracking approval requests
  - Added `stock_qty_approved` column to `shop_metadata` table
  - Created ActiveRecord model `PresentReservationQtyApproval` for ORM access

- **Updated frontend to handle approval responses** in `units/valgshop/approval/js/main.js`:
  - Added smart routing logic in `doSave()` method to route shop 9808 to approval controller
  - Added response parsing for approval status
  - Added user notification when approval is required
  - Prevents data refresh when changes are blocked for approval

### Task 3: Status Display
- **Added new status row** to shop settings table in `units/valgshop/approval/js/main.js`:
  - "Over reservering godkendt" with "Godkendt"/"Ikke godkendt" status
  - Integrated with existing shop status checking system
  - Added `getStockApprovalStatus()` method in approval controller
  - Status updates automatically when approval requests are created

## Key Features
- **Production safety**: Frontend routing ensures no impact on production shops (shop ID 9808 routes to approval controller, all others to normal controller)
- **External item validation**: Only external items (navision_item.is_external = 1) trigger approval workflow
- **Graceful handling**: Items not in navision_item table are treated as non-external (no approval needed)
- **NAV stock checking**: Uses same logic as "Tilg�ngelige gaver" column for consistency
- **Email notifications**: Automatic email to kss@gavefabrikken.dk with HTML table of affected items
- **Transaction safety**: All database operations wrapped in transactions
- **Multi-language support**: Respects shop language settings (DK=1, NO=4, SE=5)
- **Group tracking**: Uses UUID group tokens to batch related approval items
- **Debug logging**: Uses SystemLog for debugging and monitoring approval workflow
- **Smart routing**: JavaScript automatically routes shop 9808 to approval controller, all other shops to normal controller

## Database Changes Required
Run the following SQL scripts:
1. `database/migrations/create_present_reservation_qty_approval.sql`
2. `database/migrations/add_stock_qty_approved_to_shop_metadata.sql`

## Files Modified
- `units/valgshop/approval/js/main.js` - UI changes and status display
- `controller/reservationControllerApproval.php` - New separate controller with approval logic (only applies to shop ID 9808)
- `controller/reservationController.php` - Original controller restored to production state
- `units/valgshop/approval/controller.php` - Status checking endpoint
- `model/presentreservationqtyapproval.class.php` - New approval model

## Testing Notes
- Test with external items that would create negative NAV stock
- Verify email notifications are sent to kss@gavefabrikken.dk
- Confirm status display updates correctly in shop settings
- Ensure non-external items bypass approval workflow
- Verify removed columns no longer appear in reservation interface
